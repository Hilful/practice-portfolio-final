        <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Minima voluptatibus enim maiores voluptates sint vel sequi eos. Eos incidunt recusandae architecto consectetur fugit dolore praesentium debitis aliquam quos voluptatum. Facilis. I first got involved with code when I was a teenager. I remember very clearly walking home from school in eighth grade. I was about 17 and I heard my teacher say, “Check what I made!!!.” And I was like, “Wait, you can have one of those?” I used to believe only businesses or companies could have websites. I was spellbound. I went home that day and started looking up how to make websites, I grasped very basics of HTML and CSS from W3school. Later I learned I could customize my site more if I knew JavaScript. And I just kind of went from there. I tried different forums, where a lot of people got their start. I was very self-taught. I majored in computer science and and I wish to work as Software Engineer and help my clients.</p>
